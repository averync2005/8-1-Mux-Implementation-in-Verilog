# 8-1-Mux-Implementation-in-Verilog
This project implements an 8:1 multiplexer in Verilog using three different modeling styles: structural, behavioral, and dataflow. The project includes comprehensive design files and testbenches for FPGA implementation with simulation, programming, and physical testing.

Download the four Verilog files from this repository and open them in Vivado. The testbench file (Multiplexor_8to1_tb.v) is used to simulate the three implementation files (structural, behavioral, and dataflow). You can select which implementation to test by modifying the UUT declaration in the testbench file. All three implementations will produce identical waveforms and perform the same function on the FPGA. To simulate, connect your FPGA to your computer, power it on, and establish the connection in Vivado. Run a behavioral simulation to view the generated waveforms, confirming the 8:1 multiplexer functionality. Finally, program the FPGA with your chosen implementation to deploy the multiplexer on hardware.
